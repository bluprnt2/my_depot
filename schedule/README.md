# DHTMLX Schedule JavaScript Plugin

## General Info
In order to properly run the test html page, you need to download the source code of the DHTMLX Scheduler. You can find it at https://docs.dhtmlx.com/scheduler/index.html and click 'Download'.

Download the standard version. Create a folder called 'dhtmlxScheduler_v4.4.0' and extract the files here. If you want to change the directory location, be sure to edit the index.html file so it is looking in the correct folder for the stylesheet and javascript.

## Documentation
I created the index.html file by following the steps located in https://docs.dhtmlx.com/scheduler/how_to_start.html

There is plenty more documentation available, so feel free to check it out for yourself.
