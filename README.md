# Rowan University Drop-in Tutoring Application


## Description

The main goal is to make drop-in tutoring services offered by various departments more efficient. With the shared knowledgebase, tutors can pass back and forth information they find useful in providing assistance to those in need. The feedback and reporting features allow for department heads to quickly get an understanding of how frequently the drop-in tutoring service is used. Finally, students will only need to look at one location to view all of the drop-in tutoring sessions offered campus-wide. By streamlining how individual tutoring sessions are tracked, department heads will be able to get a better understanding of how effective the drop-in tutors are in providing assistance to those in need.
